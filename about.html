            <p>"Hey,i'm Surbhi Goria! Im a Frontend web developer who loves to makes beautiful things." </p>
            <p>I love building websites that are easy to use and can be accessed by anyone.</p>
            <p>My journey began by tinkering with HTML and CSS as a hobby, and it quickly turned into a full-fledged career. I'm well-versed in modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and libraries to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my recent projects, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or have a chat about all things web development!</p>
